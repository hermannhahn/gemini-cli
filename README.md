# Gemini Dev CLI

[![Gemini CLI CI](https://github.com/hermannhahn/gemini-cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hermannhahn/gemini-cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml) ![Gemini CLI Screenshot](./docs/assets/gemini-screenshot.png)

This repository contains the **Gemini Dev CLI**, a public fork of the [official Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli). Our goal is to extend and customize the tool for specific development workflows, while maintaining compatibility for future updates from the original project.

The Gemini CLI is a command-line AI workflow tool that connects to your tools, understands your code, and accelerates your workflows. With it, you can:

- Query and edit large codebases within and beyond Gemini's 1M token context window.
- Generate new applications from PDFs or sketches, using Gemini's multimodal capabilities.
- Automate operational tasks, such as querying pull requests or handling complex rebases.
- Use tools and MCP servers to connect new capabilities, including [media generation with Imagen, Veo, or Lyria](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-creative-studio/tree/main/experiments/mcp-genmedia).
- Ground your queries with the [Google Search](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding) tool, built into Gemini.

## Custom Features

This personal fork of the Gemini CLI includes the following custom features:

- **Long-Term Memory (LTM):** A tool for permanent instructions and information storage, allowing the AI to retain key details across sessions.
- **Short-Term Memory (STM):** Manages structured memories in a JSON file, providing session-specific context and enhancing interaction continuity.
- **Upstream Updates:** Regularly synchronized with the official Gemini CLI to incorporate the latest features and improvements.
- **Narrator:** Provides audio feedback for the CLI, with modes for AI actions and response summaries. The 'acts' mode has been refactored to 'thinking', and the command functionality has been restored and improved.

### Quickstart

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Node.js version 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.
2.  **Run the CLI:** Execute the following command in your terminal to install and use the Gemini Dev CLI:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @hahnd/geminid
    ```

    Then, run the CLI from anywhere:

    ```bash
    geminid
    ```

3.  **Pick a color theme**
4.  **Authenticate:** When prompted, sign in with your personal Google account. This will grant you up to 60 model requests per minute and 1,000 model requests per day using Gemini.

You are now ready to use the Gemini Dev CLI!

#### Use a Gemini API key:

The Gemini API provides a free tier with [100 requests per day](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#free-tier) using Gemini 2.5 Pro, control over which model you use, and access to higher rate limits (with a paid plan):

1.  Generate a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
2.  Set it as an environment variable in your terminal. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your generated key.

    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

3.  (Optional) Upgrade your Gemini API project to a paid plan on the API key page (will automatically unlock [Tier 1 rate limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#tier-1))

#### Use a Vertex AI API key:

The Vertex AI API provides a [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/express-mode/overview) using express mode for Gemini 2.5 Pro, control over which model you use, and access to higher rate limits with a billing account:

1.  Generate a key from [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/api-keys).
2.  Set it as an environment variable in your terminal. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your generated key and set GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI to true

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true
    ```

3.  (Optional) Add a billing account to your project to get access to [higher usage limits](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/quotas)

For other authentication methods, including Google Workspace accounts, see the [authentication](./docs/cli/authentication.md) guide.

### Examples

Once the CLI is running, you can start interacting with Gemini from your shell.

You can start from any directory:

```sh
cd new-project/
geminid
> Write me a Gemini Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

### Narrator Configuration and Usage:

The Narrator feature provides audio feedback for the Gemini CLI. You can configure its behavior using environment variables and control it with CLI commands or flags.

**Environment Variables:**

*   `MICROSOFT_TTS_KEY`: Your Microsoft Text-to-Speech API key.
*   `MICROSOFT_TTS_REGION`: The Azure region for your TTS service (e.g., `westus2`).
*   `MICROSOFT_TTS_VOICE`: The specific voice to use (e.g., `en-US-JennyNeural`). Defaults to `en-US-JennyNeural` if not set.
*   `MICROSOFT_TTS_LANGUAGE`: The language for the voice (e.g., `en-US`). Defaults to `en-US` if not set.

**Commands:**

You can switch between Narrator modes using the `/narrator` command:

*   `/narrator off`: Desativa a narra√ß√£o de √°udio.
*   `/narrator thinking`: Narra as a√ß√µes do modelo de IA (chamadas de ferramentas, pensamentos) conforme elas ocorrem.
*   `/narrator response`: Narra um resumo, observa√ß√£o ou aviso importante sobre a resposta do modelo de IA.

**Initialization Flag:**

You can set the initial Narrator mode when starting the CLI using the `--narrator` flag:

*   `--narrator [off|thinking|response]`: Define o modo inicial do narrador. Por exemplo, `--narrator thinking` iniciar√° o CLI com os pensamentos da IA narrados.
