# Short-Term Memory (STM) Feature Design

## Overview

The Short-Term Memory (STM) feature aims to provide the model with a set of tools to manage short-term memories in a structured way. These memories will be stored in a JSON file, allowing the model to efficiently add, search, and clean entries.

## Proposed Tools

The following tools have been developed as part of the STM feature:

1.  **`add_memory`**: Adds a new memory entry to the JSON file.
    - **Parameters**: `content` (string)
    - **Functionality**: Stores the provided content as a new memory entry with a unique ID, creation timestamp, and initial view timestamp.

2.  **`search_memory`**: Searches for memory entries in the JSON file.
    - **Parameters**: `query` (string, optional), `id` (string, optional), `date` (string, optional, format `YYYY-MM-DD`)
    - **Functionality**: Allows searching memories by a general term in their content, by a specific ID, or by a specific date. Returns up to 3 most relevant results based on keyword occurrences. This tool should be used when the model needs to recall information to understand the context or formulate a response, using descriptive keywords in the query. When memories are returned, their `viewed_at` timestamp is silently updated.

3.  **`delete_memory`**: Deletes a specific memory entry by its ID.
    - **Parameters**: `id` (string)
    - **Functionality**: Removes the memory entry with the specified ID from the JSON file.

4.  **`clear_stm`**: Clears (removes) memory entries from the JSON file that are older than 35 days based on their `viewed_at` timestamp.
    - **Parameters**: None
    - **Functionality**: Automatically removes entries older than 35 days. This tool is primarily for maintenance and should not be directly invoked by the model. It is designed to be run automatically to manage memory size and relevance.

## Storage Structure

Memories will be stored in a JSON file (e.g., `stm.json`) within the user's or project's configuration directory. The format will be an array of objects, where each object represents a memory with a unique `id`, `content`, `created_at` timestamp, and `viewed_at` timestamp.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "unique_memory_id_1",
    "content": "This is an example memory content.",
    "created_at": "2025-07-20T12:00:00Z",
    "viewed_at": "2025-07-20T12:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "id": "unique_memory_id_2",
    "content": "Another memory entry.",
    "created_at": "2025-07-20T12:05:00Z",
    "viewed_at": "2025-07-20T12:05:00Z"
  }
]
```

## Implementation Status

- The exact location of the `stm.json` file has been defined in `packages/core/src/utils/paths.ts`.
- The functions for reading, writing, and manipulating the JSON file have been implemented within `packages/core/src/tools/stm.ts`.
- The `add_memory`, `search_memory`, `delete_memory`, and `clear_stm` tools have been integrated into the `ToolRegistry` of the model.
- The `SearchStmTool` now returns up to 3 most relevant results, allows searching by date, and silently updates the `viewed_at` timestamp of returned memories.
- Unit and integration tests for all tools have been developed and passed.

## Controlling Status Messages

The visibility of status messages generated by STM tools (e.g., "STM entry added", "No matching STM entries found") can be controlled by the `STM_SHOW_STATUS` environment variable.

- When `STM_SHOW_STATUS` is set to `TRUE`, status messages will be displayed.
- When `STM_SHOW_STATUS` is set to any other value (or is not set), status messages will be suppressed.

This allows for a cleaner output in environments where these messages are not desired, while still providing detailed feedback when debugging or explicitly monitoring STM operations.
